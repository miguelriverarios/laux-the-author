                What happens when you spend years keeping your secrets to yourself, unprocessed and unforgotten? When
                you
                have
                obtained an identity, but you’re not sure how or why?
            </p>
            <p>
                To All The Places I’ve Had Sex Before is an expirement in truth-telling. Writing it was an opportunity
                to
                acknowledge the past, to contextualize it with my history and culture, and to learn from it.

                This book explores the ever so visible, yet ever so stigmatized subject of sex. To All The Places I’ve
                Had
                Sex
                Before is an intimate journey that begs the question, what does it mean to truly be sexually liberated
                and
                what
                measures does it take to get there, exploring the notions of private and public, the importance of
                reflection,
                and the difficulty of taking action.
            </p>
            <p>
                To All The Places I’ve Had Sex Before is a set of personal narrative essays that explore the true
                meaning of
                sexual liberation for LAUX the author.
