description="<p>As a true ENTJ, I've realized that if I want to experience all the things the world has to offer me,
            then it is my responsibility to plan those experiences. As a travel enthusiast, avid reader, and
            project manager by trade, I've decided to utilize my passion and talents in supporting my friend
            Laux as she becomes a first-time, published Black woman author. I am excited to be her book tour
            manager, and I hope to see you in your city or at a virtual book talk soon!</p>"}}
