                What happens when you spend years keeping your secrets to yourself, unprocessed and unforgotten? When
                you have obtained an identity, but you’re not sure how or why?
            </p>
            <p>
                To All The Places I’ve Had Sex Before is an expirement in truth-telling. Writing it was an opportunity
                to acknowledge the past, to contextualize it with my history and culture, and to learn from it.

                <span style="color:#F2E4B1">Season of Sincerity Introduction &mdash; </span> Earlier this month, a friend confided in me an idea she had for
                a new project. She came to me because I had worked on a similar project before. However, when I looked
                over her proposal I found it riddled with mistakes and gaps in logic. Do I tell her the truth and risk
                her losing her confidence? Or should I be nice and risk her failing? These two things are not mutually
                exclusive, but I often find myself thinking that they are.
