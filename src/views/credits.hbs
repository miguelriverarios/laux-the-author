        <p>Thank you for visiting, and for your ongoing interest and support.</p>

        <p><i>The reality is that countless people supported me at various points throughout this journey.
                Some provided feedback on the book as I was writing it.
                Others offered their expertise as I promoted myself and the book.
                Many more simply lent their ears, shoulders, and hearts throughout this long journey.
                This page is an imperfect attempt at honoring and thanking all those who left their mark in ways big and
                small. There is no such thing as
                “proper” attribution when it comes to things like this. Even if I haven't mentioned your support
                specifically, know that I appreciate you.</i></p>
